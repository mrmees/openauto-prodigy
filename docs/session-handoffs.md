## 2026-02-27 — Bluetooth cleanup, install script overhaul, aasdk removal

**What changed:**

Bluetooth:
- Created `BluetoothManager` — D-Bus Adapter1 setup, Agent1 pairing, PairedDevicesModel, auto-connect retry loop
- HSP HS profile registered by C++; HFP AG owned by PipeWire's bluez5 plugin (no conflict on fresh Trixie)
- `PairingDialog.qml` overlay for on-screen PIN confirmation
- BlueZ polkit rule for non-root pairing agent registration
- `updateConnectedDevice()` tracks Device1.Connected property changes

Install script (`install.sh`):
- Reordered: deps → build → hardware config (interactive prompts grouped after build)
- Hardware detection: INPUT_PROP_DIRECT touch filtering with device names, WiFi interface scan, audio sink selection via `pactl`
- WiFi: random password per install, country code auto-detection (iw reg → locale → ipinfo.io → US fallback), rfkill unblock
- BlueZ: `--compat` systemd override for SDP registration
- labwc: `mouseEmulation="no"` for multi-touch
- Services: openauto-prodigy, web config, system service — all created and enabled
- Launch option at end: starts app via systemd (works from SSH)
- Robustness: `{ ... exit; }` wrapper for self-update safety, ERR trap, `set -e`-safe conditionals (no `[[ ]] &&` pattern), hostapd failure non-fatal
- Build: cmake warnings suppressed by default (`--verbose`/`-v` to restore)

Documentation:
- Removed obsolete aasdk references from source code, CLAUDE.md, README, development.md, INDEX.md, aa-video-resolution.md
- Historical docs (design-decisions, debugging-notes, troubleshooting, phone-side-debug, cross-reference, archive) left as-is
- Updated roadmap: BT cleanup, install overhaul, aasdk removal → Done

**Status:** Install script validated on fresh RPi OS Trixie. Pairing works. AA connection blocked by SDP "Permission denied" (group membership needs reboot). Not yet validated end-to-end on fresh drive.

**Next steps:**
1. Reboot Pi and validate full AA session on fresh install
2. Investigate/suppress system pairing notification (draws over Prodigy UI)
3. Stale BT device pruning (two-pass approach — deferred)
4. Remove Python profile registration from codebase (Task 16 — pending)

## 2026-02-27 — Settings UI restructure & visual cleanup

**What changed:**
- Replaced settings tile grid with scrollable ListView + section headers
- Added `SettingsListItem.qml` control (icon + label + chevron)
- Added `SettingsQmlRole` to PluginModel for dynamic plugin settings pages
- Restructured AudioSettings into Output/Microphone sections
- Converted AboutSettings to Flickable
- Removed all small subtext, subtitles, hint text, and info banners from all settings pages — design rule: if it's not important enough to show prominently, it belongs in the web config panel
- Increased `rowH` (64→80) and `iconSize` (28→36) in UiMetrics for car-screen glanceability
- Removed dead `pinHint` reference from CompanionSettings
- Created `docs/settings-tree.md` — editable spec of every settings page, section, and control

**Why:**
- Original tile grid didn't scale with growing settings pages. Scrollable list with section headers is standard for settings UIs and handles any number of entries.
- Small screen at arm's length in a car needs big touch targets and no squinting at subtext.

**Status:** Complete. All 48 tests pass. Cross-compiled and validated on Pi.

**Key design rule established:**
- No `fontTiny` or `fontSmall` italic hint text on the Pi UI. Either show it at `fontBody` or move it to the web config panel.
- Edit `docs/settings-tree.md` to describe desired settings layout changes.

## 2026-02-27 — system-service shutdown timeout hardening

**What changed:**
- Updated `system-service/bt_profiles.py`:
  - `BtProfileManager.close()` now wraps `disconnect()` in try/except (called on event loop thread — `to_thread` is unsafe since dbus-next touches loop internals).
  - On exception, logs a warning and still clears `self._bus = None`.
- Updated `system-service/openauto_system.py` shutdown block:
  - Added `shutdown_sequence()` wrapped by `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=10.0)` for an overall teardown deadline.
  - Wrapped `proxy.disable()` with `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=5.0)` and warning on timeout.
  - Wrapped `ipc.stop()` with `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=3.0)` and warning on timeout.
  - If overall teardown timeout hits, logs forced shutdown error.
- Added/updated tests:
  - `system-service/tests/test_bt_profiles.py` for `close()` timeout warning + bus cleanup.
  - `system-service/tests/test_openauto_system.py` for proxy-disable timeout continuation, IPC-stop timeout warning, and overall forced-shutdown logging.

**Why:**
- Prevent shutdown deadlocks when D-Bus or bluetoothd is unresponsive and ensure teardown continues far enough to avoid lingering IPC socket/proxy state.

**Status:** Complete for requested `system-service` fixes and targeted tests. Repository-wide `ctest` has pre-existing environment/integration failures unrelated to these edits.

**Next steps:**
1. Re-run `ctest --output-on-failure` in an environment with display/network test prerequisites (or apply existing CI/headless test profile).
2. Validate daemon shutdown on target Pi with induced bluetoothd/D-Bus fault conditions.
3. If needed, add a focused `system-service` test target to CI so these Python reliability checks run independently of Qt integration constraints.

**Verification commands/results:**
- `pytest -q system-service/tests/test_bt_profiles.py`
  - Passed (`15 passed`).
- `pytest -q system-service/tests/test_openauto_system.py -k shutdown`
  - Passed (`3 passed, 9 deselected`).
- `pytest -q system-service/tests/test_openauto_system.py`
  - Passed (`12 passed`).
- `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)`
  - Passed (`Built target openauto-prodigy`).
- `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure`
  - Failed with 4 tests not related to `system-service` changes:
    - `test_tcp_transport` (listen/bind failure)
    - `test_companion_listener` (Qt platform/display plugin init failure)
    - `test_aa_orchestrator` (listen/bind failure on port 15277)
    - `test_video_frame_pool` (Qt platform/display plugin init failure)

## 2026-02-26 — Proto Repo Migration & Community Release

**What changed:**
- Created standalone repo [open-android-auto](https://github.com/mrmees/open-android-auto) with:
  - 164 proto files organized into 13 categories (moved from `libs/open-androidauto/proto/`)
  - Protocol docs: reference, cross-reference, wireless BT setup, video resolution, display rendering, phone-side debug, troubleshooting
  - Decompiled headunit firmware analysis (Alpine, Kenwood, Pioneer, Sony)
  - APK indexer tools + 156MB SQLite database (git-lfs)
- Integrated open-android-auto as git submodule in openauto-prodigy
- Updated CMakeLists.txt with custom protoc invocation (preserves `oaa/<category>/` directory structure)
- Updated 25 C++ source files (129 includes) for new proto paths
- Removed old flat proto files from openauto-prodigy
- Cleaned duplicated docs from openauto-prodigy (firmware, protocol reference, APK indexer)
- Fixed broken `docs/INDEX.md` links (aa-protocol/ paths never existed)
- Merged PR #5 (video ACK delta fix) and removed dead `ackCounter_` from both handlers

**Why:**
- Proto definitions are the most broadly useful artifact from this project. Standalone repo lets the AA community use them without pulling in the full head unit implementation.
- Deduplication keeps openauto-prodigy focused on implementation.

**Status:** Complete. Both repos pushed, Pi deployed with latest build, 48/48 tests pass.

**Key gotcha for future reference:**
- `protobuf_generate_cpp` puts all generated files flat — doesn't preserve directory structure. Must use custom `foreach` + `add_custom_command` with proper `--proto_path` when protos have subdirectory imports.

## 2026-02-26 — Video ACK Delta Fix (Gearhead RxVid Crash Candidate)

**What changed:**
- Updated video ACK behavior in `libs/open-androidauto/src/HU/Handlers/VideoChannelHandler.cpp`:
  - `AVMediaAckIndication.value` now sends delta permits (`1` per frame) instead of cumulative `ackCounter_`.
- Added regression coverage in `tests/test_video_channel_handler.cpp`:
  - `testMediaDataEmitsFrameAndAck` now sends two frames and validates both ACK payload values are `1`.

**Why:**
- Phone logs showed repeated Gearhead crash: `FATAL EXCEPTION: RxVid` with `java.lang.Error: Maximum permit count exceeded`.
- Cumulative video ACK values can over-replenish phone-side permits (triangular growth) and plausibly trigger semaphore overflow.
- Audio channel already uses delta ACK semantics; video now matches that flow-control model.

**Status:** Complete and verified locally (build + full tests pass).

**Next steps:**
1. Run extended real-device AA session (>40 minutes at 30fps) to confirm no recurrence of `RxVid` / `Maximum permit count exceeded`.
2. Capture and compare phone logcat + Pi hostapd timeline during validation session.
3. Commit and push this change set to the active Prodigy branch/PR.

**Verification commands/results:**
- `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc) --target test_video_channel_handler && ctest -R test_video_channel_handler --output-on-failure`
  - First run (before fix): failed on ACK payload value (`actual 2`, `expected 1`).
  - Second run (after fix): passed.
- `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)`
  - Passed (`Built target openauto-prodigy`).
- `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure`
  - Passed (`100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 48`).

## 2026-02-26 — Documentation Cleanup & Structured Workflow

**What changed:**
- Created structured workflow files: AGENTS.md, project-vision.md, roadmap-current.md, session-handoffs.md, wishlist.md
- Moved 10 AA protocol docs into `docs/aa-protocol/` subdirectory
- Imported openauto-pro-community repo into `docs/OpenAutoPro_archive_information/` (18 files)
- Consolidated 57 completed plan docs into 5 milestone summaries (`milestone-01` through `milestone-05`)
- Moved 3 active plans to `docs/plans/active/`
- Moved 4 workspace loose files to `docs/OpenAutoPro_archive_information/needs-review/`
- Rewrote INDEX.md to match new structure
- Rewrote CLAUDE.md — trimmed from ~20KB to ~15KB, removed stale status/philosophy sections, added workflow references
- Updated workspace CLAUDE.md to reflect consolidation
- Trimmed MEMORY.md to remove content now captured in milestone summaries

**Why:** 10 days of intense development left docs scattered across 3 repos with no workflow structure. Companion-app had a proven AGENTS.md workflow loop — replicated it here.

**Status:** Complete. All 14 tasks executed. Commits are on `feat/proxy-routing-exceptions` branch.

**Next steps:**
1. Review `docs/OpenAutoPro_archive_information/needs-review/` files — decide final disposition for miata-hardware-reference.md (likely move to main docs as plugin input)
2. Start using the workflow loop — next session should reference roadmap-current.md priorities
3. Consider archiving the openauto-pro-community GitHub repo now that content is imported

**Verification:**
- 14 reference docs at `docs/` root
- 5 milestone summaries + 3 active plans in `docs/plans/`
- 10 AA protocol docs in `docs/aa-protocol/`
- 22 archive files in `docs/OpenAutoPro_archive_information/`
- No orphaned plan files

## 2026-02-28 — Fix Python Proto Parser Test Paths

**What changed:**
- Updated `tools/test_proto_parser.py` to use current proto locations under `libs/open-androidauto/proto/oaa/...`.
- Updated one stale expectation in `test_parse_message` from `cardinality: required` to `cardinality: optional` to match current proto3 optional fields.

**Why:**
- `tools/test_*.py` had 5 failing parser tests due to stale file paths from older proto layout and one outdated cardinality expectation.

**Status:** Complete. Parser tests now pass.

**Next steps:**
1. If desired, we can do the same path-audit for any other standalone scripts that hardcode old proto paths.
2. Keep `tools/test_*.py` in regular CI/local verification since they caught real drift.

**Verification commands/results:**
- `python3 -m pytest tools/test_*.py -v` -> `19 passed`.
- `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` -> build passed.
- `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` -> `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 50`.

## 2026-02-28 — Protocol Capture Dumps (JSONL/TSV) for Proto Validation

**What changed:**
- Extended `oaa::ProtocolLogger` (`libs/open-androidauto`) with:
  - output mode switch: `TSV` (existing) or `JSONL` (validator-ready)
  - media payload inclusion toggle (`include_media`)
  - JSONL rows with fields: `ts_ms`, `direction`, `channel_id`, `message_id`, `message_name`, `payload_hex`
- Wired capture lifecycle in `AndroidAutoOrchestrator`:
  - starts capture on new AA session when enabled
  - attaches at messenger layer (`session_->messenger()`)
  - closes/detaches on teardown
- Added new YAML defaults under `connection.protocol_capture.*`:
  - `enabled: false`
  - `format: "jsonl"`
  - `include_media: false`
  - `path: "/tmp/oaa-protocol-capture.jsonl"`
- Removed duplicate app-local logger implementation and test:
  - deleted `src/core/aa/ProtocolLogger.hpp/.cpp`
  - deleted `tests/test_oap_protocol_logger.cpp`
  - removed related CMake entries
- Updated docs:
  - `docs/config-schema.md` (new capture keys + examples)
  - `docs/roadmap-current.md` (done item)
  - `docs/aa-troubleshooting-runbook.md` (test reference updated)

**Why:**
- Enable repeatable capture dumps that can feed protobuf regression validation tooling directly.
- Avoid high-noise AV payloads by default while preserving optional inclusion when needed.
- Remove duplicate logger code paths to prevent drift.

**Status:** Complete. Build + full test suite pass.

**Next steps:**
1. Add UI/web-config controls for `connection.protocol_capture.*` so capture can be toggled without manual YAML edits.
2. Capture one real AA non-media session and run it through `open-android-auto` validator workflow.
3. If needed, add capture rotation/size limits for long-running sessions.

**Verification commands/results:**
- RED (expected before implementation):
  - `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` -> failed in `test_oaa_protocol_logger` (missing `setFormat` / `setIncludeMedia`).
  - `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure -R "test_yaml_config|test_config_key_coverage"` -> failed on missing `connection.protocol_capture.*` defaults.
- GREEN (after implementation):
  - `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)` -> passed (`Built target openauto-prodigy`).
  - `cd build && ctest --output-on-failure` -> `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 51`.
  - `./cross-build.sh` -> passed (`Build complete: build-pi/src/openauto-prodigy`).

## 2026-02-28 — Fix `install.sh --list-prebuilt` in No-TERM Environments

**What changed:**
- Updated `install.sh` `print_header()` to avoid calling `clear` when running in non-interactive/no-`TERM` contexts.
- Updated `tests/test_install_list_prebuilt.py` to explicitly unset `TERM` in the test environment so CI/ctest consistently validates this path.

**Why:**
- `test_install_list_prebuilt` could fail when `TERM` was unset because `clear` exited non-zero under `set -e`, causing `install.sh --list-prebuilt` to exit before listing releases.

**Status:** Complete and verified locally.

**Next steps:**
1. Commit and push this fix branch.
2. Open PR noting that installer list mode now works in minimal/CI environments.

**Verification commands/results:**
- `cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc) && ctest --output-on-failure`
  - Passed (`100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 51`).
