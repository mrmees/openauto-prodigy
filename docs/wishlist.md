## Candidate Ideas

- **Per-connection WiFi password rotation** — Generate a fresh random WPA password each time a phone connects via BT RFCOMM, update hostapd (`hostapd_cli set wpa_passphrase` + reload), then send the new password to the phone. Eliminates any static credential. Requires coordinating hostapd reload timing with the BT handshake.
